# Clustering_model

Here we have a gambling dataset with 50000 rows and 9 columns. It contains at least 4000 users' games value. 
* By doing simple EDA we find that we need moew features to idenfity the gameplay of the players. 
* Creating new features with factors of great importance in the game.
* We perform grouping of players by users statistics first then all over clusters are formed by using K-means algorithm.
* We visualize the clusters with paralle coordinates plot. And analyze the groups by parallel coorniates plot and grouped cluster average values to name them.
